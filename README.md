One of the platforms I develop MaraDNS on (a 2003-era version of
MinGW) doesnâ€™t have `inet_pton` to convert strings in to
IPv6 addresses (it has `inet_addr` for IPv4 addresses, but
nothing for IPv6).

That in mind, I am making this public domain C function which
converts a string in to an IPv6 address.
